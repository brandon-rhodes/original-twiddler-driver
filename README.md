# Driver for the Original HandyKey Twiddler

This is a simple prototype driver
for the original Twiddler one-handed keyboard made by HandyKey.
It is written in Python, reads Twiddler data from the serial port,
and produces X Windows events using ``xdotool``
which you will need to have installed with:

    apt install xdotool

It is still a work in progress.
Iâ€™ll write a blog post about the story behind it.
